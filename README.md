Custom Workouts: Allows users to choose between running or cycling workouts, input key workout data (distance, duration, etc.), and logs this information.
Data Persistence: Workout data is saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that user information persists even after the page is refreshed.
Custom Pop-ups: Provides dynamic pop-ups on the map to display workout details, including the type of activity, distance, and time.
Responsive Design: Adaptable across various devices ensuring a smooth user experience whether on desktop or mobile.
Technologies Used:
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for the core structure, styling, and functionality of the app.
Leaflet.js: A lightweight and open-source library for rendering interactive maps.
Geolocation API: Used to retrieve the user's location for logging workout positions.
LocalStorage: Browser-based data storage for persisting workout details across sessions.
